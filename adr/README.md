# Architecture Decision Records

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences.
There's no specific standard format for adr, so I decided to pick the main points that I would like to share about each decision.

Each ADR specifies: 
* Context and Problem Statement
* Considered Options
* Decision Outcome
* Positive Consequences
* Negative Consequences
* Pros and Cons of each option
* References (optional)


### ADRs:
1. [Schedule Reminder](./schedule-reminder.md)
2. [Websocket Server](./websocket-server.md)
3. [Message Broker](./message-broker.md)
4. [Database](./database.md)
